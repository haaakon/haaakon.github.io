<p>Finally, after a long time i`ve managed to setup my blog on a github page. I am using Jekyll Bootstrap, which now seems to not gotten a release since early 2012. It works neitherless, you <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">can check it out</a> yourself.</p>
<p>To bother do any blogging i need an editor. I`ve used <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> before, and decided to give it a try. To use MarsEdit on a github pages based blog running jekyll wasn`t easy to setup. After some tinkering around i found <a href="https://movieos.org/blog/2011/4306667186/">this blogpost </a> describing how to do the setup. You have to run a service called Jekyll Metaweblog for MarsEdit to find the jekyll made posts. </p>
